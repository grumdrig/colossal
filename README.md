Colossal Tarpit
===============

Programming is no game...until now! Colossal Tarpit is the text
adventure that's Turing complete, a prosegramming language. It was
written to be an entry in the [Dec 2012 PLT Games competition][1],
which calls for programming languages that can do anything, but never
should.
