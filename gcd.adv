This implements Euler's algorithm to compute greatest common divisor:

given a, b with a > b
repeat:
  divide a by b
  if remainder == 0:
    GCD is b
  else
    let a = b, b = r

Here's the basic Adventure implementation:

TEST-B:
  sort so A >= B
  B says DIVIDE
  H says DONE

DONE:
  dunk the A

DIVIDE:
  move dirt from T into B
  A says SUBTRACT
  B says TEST-B

SUBTRACT:
  (dig out of B into T, A into nowhere)
  B says SUBTRACT
  H says DIVIDE
